#### A Package Manager for Game Developers. Have you ever needed a small script or plugin and had to go find it? Poly makes all this easier.
#### The web has NPM, Bower and a million others. I dont want all of their shit. I want only gamedev related packages and I want to install them where I want to!

##What is this?

This is a package manager made for game devs. Most game devs just want to easily pull down plugins and put them in their desired location. NPM makes it convenient by putting everything in a "nodemodules" folder but they aren't writing games for 6+ SKU's on different hardware. We need to easily pull down plugins, scripts, and placeholder art and put them in a location *we choose*.
